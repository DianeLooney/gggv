# Go Video Developer [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/DianeLooney/gvd/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/DianeLooney/gvd/tree/master)

Command-line video editing environment. Not intended for use as a package.

How to build:

Linux: follow along in the dockerfile at `build/gvd-base` to install the dependencies from source, and `build/gvd` to install gvd.

OSX builds are similar to the Linux builds, but exact steps are not given.

Pre-built windows binaries are available through CircleCI as a build artifact. If you wish to build from source, follow along with the `win-build` entry in `.circleci/config.yml`.
